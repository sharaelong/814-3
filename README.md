# Progress

1. 2-approximation and square grid  
Score: 36515513.01  
Time: 12ms, relatively fast.  
It is well-known so chatgpt do it well. Also I assigned first 19 cities to extra salesmen, and divide whole grid 11x11 square and assign each square to each saleman.  

2. Improve square grid to use 10x14 grid  
Score: 32342713.38  
Time: 12ms, same as before  
It uses every salesmen in tour.  

3. 2-opt heuristic  
Score: 26611309.87  
Time: 552ms  
I applied new technique to find more improved TSP, no change to clustering. ChatGPT gives a code about it. Also I made 32ms time limit for each salesman instance so it will not exceed time limit. However real time is 552ms which means every subproblem was solved under 32ms.  

4. Clustering with K-means  
Score: 34219073.69  
Time: 1120ms  
I used k-means for clustering (which also given by ChatGPT), but it shows worse results than naive 10x14 grid. Max iteration was 100, and clustering takes time about 550ms purely. I don't have any intuition about how k-means groups points in random distribution...  

5. 2-opt with random initial tour
Score: 26519866.54  
Time: 760ms  
I called 2-opt function multiple time with random initial tour. But solution quality is not improved at much.  

6. 3-opt heuristic  
Score: 25835278.68  
Time: 1384ms  
I used 3-opt heuristic instead of multiple 2-opt heuristic. It showed 2.6% performance gain, which is similar as other resource's experiment results. Check every 3-opt moves and select best move. However, I can see execution time is increased sharply.  

7. Dynamic clustering  
Score: 25241052.9  
Time: 4352ms  
This clustering algorithm tries moving points from a randomly selected cluster to a randomly selected adjacent cluster. Cluster is initialized with 10x14 grid, so neighbors of certain cluster refer to those connected on four sides. The selection probability is exponential value to current cluster's tour length. When point moving increases max tour length between two cluster, rollback that changes.  
Some lessons I got from this:
- BOJ is much slower than my local machine. It's easy to overestimate algorithm performance.
- Just moving single point is really weak.
- Exponential probability of choice is good heuristic, indeed it seems necessary.
- 3-opt is not good to use as a blackbox for its huge variance.
- Heuristic depends on area of cluster convex hull is not good, because sharp shape has small area but increases tour length significantly.

8. Some fancy dynamic clustering
Score: Catastrophe!
Time: Also too long!
I used many approaches in this step. But everything failed. Inscribed circle area of delaunay triangulation, MST length of group, connectivity constraint in every move are not enough to avoid points floated over space wide. Inherently triangulation become weird at the edge of the region. To meet this issue I tried to define 'adjacency' between two points at maximum distance of d, but it was not good approach either.

# Remaining Ideas
- Grouping some points before any calculation. For example we can assume that two points within a distance of 1000 are expected to belong in same group at last. Then treat this grouped points as single point, 7th approach will become better because single point movement is actually multiple points movement.

# Utilities
- `score.sh`: compile main source code and score calculator, print score. `tmp-file` is temporary file for saving result.
- `gen.sh`: re-generate test cases.
- `visualizer.py`: visualize cluster result.
